<h3>About</h3>
<p>
This is a game inspired by my own mind.
</p>
<p>
Often, I find my mind zooming in a hundred different directions. It is
extremely inconvenient when I want to be focused on something.
</p>
<p>
Once I am able to focus, my mind gradually aligns, piece by piece,
until, like a magnet, I have a lot of mental force at my disposal, all
pointing at whatever I want to work on.
</p>
<p>
Of course, getting started here is the problem. So, I thought, why not
make a game around it?
</p>
<p>
The outcome of this idea, a game to cause me to slowly become more and
more focused, is Fluvia. If it works, it will take me, and anyone else
who plays, from various starting mental states into Flow. From there,
other work can become much easier.
</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<p>
The controls are extremely simple.
</p>
<p>
Each level will have a number of spheres. Some will have letters on
them. When you hold a key  corresponding to a sphere down, the sphere
will start to move along the gray path extending away from it.
</p>
<p>
There are no directions, no changing angles, and no backtracking. Your
sphere has a track to follow, and like a train, it will do so whenever
it is told to.
</p>
<p>
Do not let your sphere(s) touch any other ones. If a collision occurs,
you will have to go back to the beginning of the level set. Don't get
discouraged! Playing through levels you already have will help refocus
your mind.
</p>
<p>
When you have guided all of the spheres on the level to the ends of
their tracks, marked by light orange spheres, the level has been
completed, and you will move on.
