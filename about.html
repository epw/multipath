<h3>About</h3>
<p>
This is a game inspired by my own mind.
</p>
<p>
Often, I find my mind zooming in a hundred different directions. It is
extremely inconvenient when I want to be focused on something.
</p>
<p>
Once I am able to focus, my mind gradually aligns, piece by piece,
until, like a magnet, I have a lot of mental force at my disposal, all
pointing at whatever I want to work on.
</p>
<p>
Of course, getting started here is the problem. So, I thought, why not
make a game around it?
</p>
<p>
The outcome of this idea, a game to cause me to slowly become more and
more focused, is Fluvia. If it works, it will take me, and anyone else
who plays, from various starting mental states into Flow. From there,
other work can become much easier.
</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<p>
The controls are extremely simple.
</p>
<p>
Each level will have a number of spheres. Some will have letters on
them. When you hold a key  corresponding to a sphere down, the sphere
will start to move along the gray path extending away from it.
</p>
<p>
There are no directions, no changing angles, and no backtracking. Your
sphere has a track to follow, and like a train, it will do so whenever
it is told to.
</p>
<p>
Do not let your sphere(s) touch any other ones. If a collision occurs,
you will have to go back to the beginning of the level you were
on.
</p>
<p>
When you have guided all of the spheres on the level to the ends of
their tracks, marked by light orange spheres, the level has been
completed, and you will move on.
</p>

  makes sense for other people. Hopefully, though, this will help get
  some people started.</em>
</p>
<p>
The controls and explanations on the side of the canvas have the key
you can press to activate them in square brackets.
</p>
<p>
To create a new sphere on a path that will move on its own, select
"New path" and then click where you want the sphere to start on the
canvas. You will notice that your cursor has changed into crosshairs
while you are positioning it. Once it has been placed, a line will
extend towards your mouse, locked into certain angles. You may hold
[Shift] to set the path at any angle.
</p>
<p>
You may continue clicking and placing piece of the path until you are
on the last one. The final section may be placed by hitting the [.] or
middle-clicking. This will extend the path one final time to where
your mouse is.
</p>
<p>
If you ever make a mistake and wish to delete the most recent piece of
the path, hit the [-] key.
</p>
<p>
To create a path which will be followed by the player, use the same
technique, but instead of clicking "New path" or hitting the [N] key,
hit any of the keys in the rectangle marked by [Q], [R], [V], and
[Z]. You may make more than one path with any given key.
</p>
<p>
To delete an entire path, click "Delete path" and then click on the
sphere beginning the path.
</p>
<p>
If you click "Snap Grid", a gray grid of lines will appear on the
canvas. It will cause spheres and path corners to snap to the nearest
grid intersection, unless you are holding [Shift]. The "Snap Grid"
button can be clicked again to turn it back off.
</p>
<p>
To cause a path to become a loop, in which the sphere will vanish from
the end point and reappear at the beginning each time it finishes,
click the "Make loops" button. All spheres on paths which are loops
will change color. You can click on spheres to cause them to return to
normal, or change to the new color, indicating that they will
loop. Click "Make loops" a second time to return to the normal view
and be able to create and delete paths again.
</p>
<p>
To "save" a level, select all of the text in the small "Current level
data" box, either by triple-clicking in it, or right-clicking and
selecting "Select all", and copy it. Paste this string into a file on
your computer. If you would like to see the level included in Fluvia,
email it to me. In the future a direct way to upload them may be
added.
</p>
<p>
To load a level which you have the text for (such as selected and
copied from a file you created by saving a level), paste it into the
"Insert new level data:" text box, and then click load. The level
should appear in the editing as it was when it was saved.
</p>

<h3>What are you talking about? I don't see anything. Spheres? What is
  this?</h3>

It sounds like your browser might not support the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt;
tag. If you are on an old version of Internet Explorer, certain simple
  mobile browsers, or extremely old versions of any other browsers,
  you may be unable to play this game. Sorry.
